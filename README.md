I first observed the summerize function in the assignment and tried to mimic the type of data it was operating on. 
Based on that, I used the batting baseball dataset. After checking null values and data types, I chose to use the yearID as the variable to group the other fields since it had the least amount of unique values. 
I then set up the function by looking at five different variables that have to do with hitting over the years of collected data. 
This groupby function showed that hits seemed to stay relatively constant as the years progressed while home runs drastically increased. 
However, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions due to the low amount of samples during the early years.
